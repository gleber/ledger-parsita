# Project Brief

This document serves as the foundational project brief for ledger-parsita.

## Project Goals

- Parse hledger journal files.
- Provide filtering capabilities for journal entries.
- Implement a tool to track capital gains of closed positions in hledger journal files.
- Potentially provide other reporting features based on parsed data.

## Core Requirements

- Accurate parsing of hledger journal syntax.
- Efficient filtering of transactions and postings.
- Maintain data integrity during parsing and processing.
- Implement capital gains tracking using dated subaccounts and FIFO logic.
- Update hledger journal files in place to record capital gains transactions.

## Scope

- Initial focus on parsing and basic filtering.
- Primary focus is now on implementing the capital gains tracking tool.
- Future scope may include advanced reporting and integrations beyond capital gains.
